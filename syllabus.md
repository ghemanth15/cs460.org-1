Syllabus for CS460 Computer Graphics {#syllabus-for-cs460-computer-graphics .unnumbered}
====================================

Web-based 3D Visualizations {#web-based-3d-visualizations .unnumbered}
---------------------------

After completion of this course, you will be able to develop rich and
interactive web-based 3D visualizations for computers, smartphones, and
tablets! By using WebGL, you will learn to create immersive and
high-quality graphics including 3D geometric transformations, camera
transformations, the image-rendering process, as well as materials and
texture mapping. This course also includes advanced topics such as color
representations, light simulation, dealing with geometries, and creating
animations. And since everything runs in the browser, you can show your
work to your friends with a link to a website—how cool is that!\
**We will learn and use:**

-   JavaScript (including some HTML and CSS)

-   XTK (<https://goXTK.com>)

-   Three.js (<https://threejs.org>) and other WebGL frameworks of your
    choice

-   GLSL and “vanilla” WebGL

-   glTF (<https://www.khronos.org/gltf/>)

-   Github / git (for version control and assignment submission)

-   Overleaf / LaTeX (for reports)

Course Structure {#course-structure .unnumbered}
----------------

41 Lectures\
10 Assignments (30% of final grade, plus 10% bonus)\
13 Quizzes (20% of final grade, take-home through blackboard)\
Final Project (40% of final grade)\
Participation (in-class, in-office, and as part of blackboard

researchers.

Final Grade {#final-grade .unnumbered}
-----------

The weighted scores from above will result in a final grade as follows:\

  --------------- --------------------
  $\geq$ 90 = A         69-66 = C
  89-86 = A-            65-62 = C-
  85-82 = B+            61-58 = D+
  81-78 = B             57-54 = D
  77-74 = B-            53-50 = D-
  73-70 = C+            below 50 = F
  --------------- --------------------

The “STRAIGHT A”-Shortcut {#the-straight-a-shortcut .unnumbered}
-------------------------

There are **two special ways to get a straight A** in this course:
**(1)** if we can submit your final project to the 25th International
ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology (<https://web3d2020.web3d.org/>), or
**(2)** if your final project significantly contributes to an existing
open source library and gets merged back into the parent code repository
(new features, or important bugfixes).

Interactive Lectures (Bring your Laptop!) {#interactive-lectures-bring-your-laptop .unnumbered}
-----------------------------------------

Lectures will include interactive components. Please bring your laptop.
If you do not have a laptop, please contact the teaching staff at
[staff@cs460.org](staff@cs460.org).

Assignments {#assignments .unnumbered}
-----------

Weekly assignments include research questions and coding challenges. All
assignments require a written report in LaTeX. You will use a standard
git workflow to submit your work. Instructions and templates are
available in the Blackboard system. **Assignments are due Mondays at
11:59pm. No late submissions.**

Quizzes {#quizzes .unnumbered}
-------

Quizzes include multiple-choice and free-text questions. They are
take-home quizzes and available in the Blackboard system. **Quizzes are
due Fridays at 11:59pm. No late submissions.**

Final Project {#final-project .unnumbered}
-------------

The final project is the capstone of this course and counts as 40% of
your final grade. This is your chance to apply your newly learned
skills. You can fully enjoy the freedom and come up with your project
idea or you can ask the teaching staff for suggestions. Project teams
are encouraged but working alone is also fine. In lecture 37, all
students will present their final project plans as part of the fast
forward event. The following week, all students will present progress
towards their final delivery. **And finally, all projects, including
reports are due on 12/20/2019. No late submissions.**

Participation {#participation .unnumbered}
-------------

Class attendance and participation, as well as posts in the Blackboard
discussion forum count towards your grade. Please skip at most 4 classes
and contribute at least once to every official discussion topic, if you
want a 100% participation score.

Collaboration Policy {#collaboration-policy .unnumbered}
--------------------

You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate with anybody. However,
please make sure to give proper credit. For instance, if your friend
helps you with an assignment or you copied code from another source, you
must acknowledge their name in your code and the assignment report.

Open Source License {#open-source-license .unnumbered}
-------------------

The course material is publicly available under the MIT license
(<https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>). This includes assignment code.
You are free to adopt a different license for your assignment solutions.

Readings {#readings .unnumbered}
--------

There are no required readings for this course. However, the material is
based on the following three books:

-   Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics by S. Gortler

-   WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with
    WebGL by K. Matsuda and R. Lea

-   Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja by J. Resig and B. Bibeault

Limited copies of all books are available through the teaching staff.
While the books are great, **you do not need to purchase them**—the most
up-to-date information is available online.

Disability Accomodations {#disability-accomodations .unnumbered}
------------------------

If you have a disability and feel you will need accommodation to
complete course requirements, please contact the Ross Center for
Disability Services at 617.287.7430.
