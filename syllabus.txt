Syllabus for CS460 Computer Graphics
====================================

Web-based 3D Visualizations
---------------------------

After completing this course, you will be able to develop rich and interactive 
web-based 3D visualizations for computers,
smartphones, and tablets!  By using WebGL, you will learn to create immersive 
and high-quality graphics, including 3D
geometric transformations, camera transformations, the image-rendering process, 
as well as materials and texture map-
ping. This course also includes advanced topics such as color representations, 
light simulation, dealing with geometries,
and creating animations. And since everything runs in the browser, you can show 
your work to your friends with a link to
a website—how cool is that!

**We will learn and use:**

-  JavaScript (including some HTML and CSS)

-  XTK (https://goXTK.com)

-  Three.js (https://threejs.org) and other WebGL frameworks of your choice

-  GLSL and default WebGL

-  glTF (https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)

-  Github / git (for version control and assignment submission)

-  Overleaf / LATEX (for reports)


** Due to COVID-19 all lectures are remote. ** Our default video conferencing 
software is Zoom but we will use other
platforms (https://frameVR.io,  https://gather.town,  ...)   during the 
semester to see how we can best create an
inclusive learning community that welcomes everyone!

Course Structure
----------------

38 Lectures
10 Assignments (30% of final grade, plus 10% bonus)
13 Quizzes (20% of final grade, take-home through blackboard)
Final Project (40% of final grade)
Participation (in-class (remote), in-office (remote), and as part of blackboard 
discussions, 10% of final grade)
No exams

We will have **multiple guest lectures** from experienced graphics researchers.

Final Grade
-----------

The weighted scores from above will result in a final grade as follows:

>90 = A              69-66 = C
89-86 = A-           65-62 = C-
85-82 = B+           61-58 = D+
81-78 = B            57-54 = D
77-74 = B-           53-50 = D-
73-70 = C+           below 50 = F

The ”STRAIGHT A”-Shortcut
-------------------------

There are **two special ways to get a straight A** in this course: (1) if we can 
submit your final project to the International
ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology (https://www.web3d.org/conferences), or (2) 
if your final project significantly
contributes to an existing open source library and gets merged back into the 
parent code repository (new features, or
important bugfixes).


Interactive Lectures
--------------------

Lectures will include interactive components. If you do not have a laptop or 
reliable internet, please contact the teaching
staff at staff@cs460.org.


Assignments
-----------

Weekly assignments include research questions and coding challenges. All 
assignments require a written report in LATEX.
You will use a standard git workflow to submit your work.  Instructions and 
templates are available in the Blackboard
system. Assignments are due Mondays at 11:59pm. No late submissions.


Quizzes
-------

Quizzes include multiple-choice and free-text questions.  They are take-home 
quizzes and available in the Blackboard
system. Quizzes are due Fridays at 11:59pm. No late submissions.


Final Project
-------------

The final project is the capstone of this course and counts as 40% of your 
final grade. This is your chance to apply your
newly learned skills.  You can fully enjoy the freedom and come up with your 
project idea or you can ask the teaching
staff for suggestions. Project teams are encouraged but working alone is also 
fine. In lecture 37, all students will present
their final project plans as part of the fast forward event.  The following 
week, all students will present progress towards
their final delivery. And finally, all projects, including reports are due on 
12/21/2020. No late submissions.


Participation
-------------

Remote class attendance and participation, as well as posts in the Blackboard 
discussion forum count towards your
grade.  Please skip at most 4 classes and contribute at least once to every 
official discussion topic, if you want a 100%
participation score.


Collaboration Policy
--------------------

You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate with anybody.  However, please 
make sure to give proper credit.  For
instance, if your friend helps you with an assignment or you copied code from 
another source, you must acknowledge
their name in your code and the assignment report.


Open Source License
-------------------

The course material is publicly available under the MIT license 
(https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This includes
assignment code. You are free to adopt a different license for your assignment 
solutions.


Readings
--------

There are no required readings for this course. However, the material is based 
on the following three books:

-  Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics by S. Gortler

-  WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL by 
K. Matsuda and R. Lea

-  Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja by J. Resig and B. Bibeault

Limited copies of all books are available through the teaching staff.  While 
the books are great, you do not need to
purchase them—the most up-to-date information is available online.


Disability Accommodations
-------------------------

If you have a disability and feel you will need accommodation to complete 
course requirements, please contact the Ross
Center for Disability Services at 617.287.7430.
