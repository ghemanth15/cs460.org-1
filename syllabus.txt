Syllabus for CS460 Computer Graphics
Web-based 3D Visualizations
After completion of this course, you will be able to develop rich and interactive web-based 3D visualizations for comput-
ers, smartphones, and tablets! By using WebGL, you will learn to create immersive and high-quality graphics including
3D geometric transformations, camera transformations, the image-rendering process, as well as materials and texture
mapping. This course also includes advanced topics such as color representations, light simulation, dealing with geome-
tries, and creating animations. And since everything runs in the browser, you can show your work to your friends with a
link to a website—how cool is that!

We will learn and use:

   • JavaScript (including some HTML and CSS)
   • XTK (https://goXTK.com)
   • Three.js (https://threejs.org) and other WebGL frameworks of your choice

   • GLSL and ”vanilla” WebGL
   • glTF (https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)
   • Github / git (for version control and assignment submission)
   • Overleaf / LATEX (for reports)

FCK COVID! This is an in-person course. To stay safe, we need to follow the university policies of wearing masks and
social distancing.

Course Structure
41 Lectures
10 Assignments (30% of final grade, plus 10% bonus)
13 Quizzes (20% of final grade, take-home through blackboard)
Final Project (40% of final grade)
Participation (in-class, in-office, and as part of blackboard discussions, 10% of final grade)
No exams

We will have multiple guest lectures from experienced graphics researchers.

Final Grade
The weighted scores from above will result in a final grade as follows:

    ≥ 90 = A           69-66 = C
    89-86 = A-         65-62 = C-
    85-82 = B+         61-58 = D+
    81-78 = B          57-54 = D
    77-74 = B-         53-50 = D-
    73-70 = C+         below 50 = F

The ”STRAIGHT A”-Shortcut
There are two special ways to get a straight A in this course: (1) if we can submit your final project to the International
ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology (https://www.web3d.org/conferences), or (2) if your final project significantly
contributes to an existing open source library and gets merged back into the parent code repository (new features, or
important bugfixes).

Interactive Lectures (Bring your Laptop!)
Lectures will include interactive components. Please bring your laptop. If you do not have a laptop, please contact the
teaching staff at staff@cs460.org.

Assignments
Weekly assignments include research questions and coding challenges. All assignments require a written report in LATEX.
You will use a standard git workflow to submit your work. Instructions and templates are available in the Blackboard
system. Assignments are due Mondays at 11:59pm. No late submissions.

Quizzes
Quizzes include multiple-choice and free-text questions. They are take-home quizzes and available in the Blackboard
system. Quizzes are due Fridays at 11:59pm. No late submissions.

Final Project
The final project is the capstone of this course and counts as 40% of your final grade. This is your chance to apply your
newly learned skills. You can fully enjoy the freedom and come up with your project idea or you can ask the teaching
staff for suggestions. Project teams are encouraged but working alone is also fine. In lecture 37, all students will present
their final project plans as part of the fast forward event. The following week, all students will present progress towards
their final delivery. And finally, all projects, including reports are due on 12/20/2021. No late submissions.

Participation
Class attendance and participation, as well as posts in the Blackboard discussion forum count towards your grade. Please
skip at most 4 classes and contribute at least once to every official discussion topic, if you want a 100% participation score.


Collaboration Policy
You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate with anybody. However, please make sure to give proper credit. For
instance, if your friend helps you with an assignment or you copied code from another source, you must acknowledge
their name in your code and the assignment report.


Open Source License
The course material is publicly available under the MIT license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This includes
assignment code. You are free to adopt a different license for your assignment solutions.


Readings
There are no required readings for this course. However, the material is based on the following three books:

   • Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics by S. Gortler
   • WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL by K. Matsuda and R. Lea

   • Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja by J. Resig and B. Bibeault

Limited copies of all books are available through the teaching staff. While the books are great, you do not need to
purchase them—the most up-to-date information is available online.


Disability Accomodations
If you have a disability and feel you will need accommodation to complete course requirements, please contact the Ross
Center for Disability Services at 617.287.7430.
